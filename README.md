D3-fisheye
========

Playing with D3 and fisheye plugin.

Check the working demo on http://rawgithub.com/glena/D3-fisheye/master/index.html

Why?
----

I am learning D3.js. This is the result of viewing the tutorial about fisheye of @enjalot (and also a little help of him). You can find the tutorial on http://vimeo.com/55189469
